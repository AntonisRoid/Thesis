# MSc Thesis Project Files


- **Train_bayes_pr:** Bayesian optimization to get the optimal set of hyperparameters for the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model

- **Train_bayes_gru_pr.py:** Bayesian optimization to get the optimal set of hyperparameters for the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model

- **cor.R:** produces a correlation graph for the predictor variables

- **functions.py:** contains important functions that are used by other scripts

- **Missing_data_graphs.ipynb:** graphs illustrating the missing data that exist in patients' diaries 

- **Split.ipynb:** spliting of the data in train and test set

- **Predictions_performance.ipynb:** evalutation of the performance of the resulting LSTM and GRU models

- **Results_Explainability:** Detailed look on the accuracy of the predictions of both models, comparison of LSTM & GRU and exploration of the explainability of the models.
